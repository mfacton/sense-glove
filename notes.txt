should use 0.8mm board thickness for smaller profile

do testing with 3 wire spi

assembly with epoxy so print wall thickness can be rather small

use foam padding on bottom 1/16 inch is common

potentially use wire shroud or heat shrink depending on stiffness

leave epoxy opening underneath so it can be filled and sanded

make each finder strip replacable

If it's not too bad, possibly use flex pcb

lazer cuttable stencil for later

possibly add touch sensing or haptic feedback with electrosmotic pumps

assembly cut all wires(and extra refrence(uncut)) to exact length first

solder both ends of one wire before moving to next one

preferably do all assembly in on sitting to get wire strip and lengths as close as possible

bend wires so boards lay on their side (easy angle to solder)

a little bit oh heatshrink in the middle of the wiring

just use flexpcb for fingers

use esp32 with octal or quad spi for rf transfer

use ethernet for communication back to computer
most likely with another esp32 and small fpga
